# cr_scrap

**cr_scrap** creates a raw csv file with the following structure:

```csv
Anime title on Crunchyrool; CR link; Anime title on MyAnimeList.net; MyAL link; Genres
```

You can customize the output as much as you like to get other metadata you're interested in.

By printing `mal_anime` you'll get the JSON code for that particular anime entry. Then you can analyze the JSON output to figure out which metadata you want and make changes to the code in order to get them.

Enjoy!

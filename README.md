# cr_scrap

**cr_scrap** creates a raw csv file with the following structure:

```csv
Anime title on Crunchyrool; CR link; English title on MyAnimeList.net; MyAL link;  Japanese title on MyAnimeList.net; Genres

You can customize the output as much as you like to get other metadata you're interested in.

Enjoy!
